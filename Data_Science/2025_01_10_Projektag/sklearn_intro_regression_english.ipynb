    ">This notebook introduces the concepts of Machine Learning and more particularly linear regression, in order to show to what extent Python is a programming language adapted to machine learning problems. All these concepts will be presented in more detail and put into practice in the modules dedicated to Machine Learning.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Machine Learning is a sub-field of Artificial Intelligence, which gives the computer the ability to learn to automatically perform tasks from data. When the task to be performed is the prediction of a variable, we speak of supervised learning.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Linear regression is one of the first supervised learning predictive models to have been studied. This model makes it possible to predict a quantitative variable. Today it is the most popular model for practical applications thanks to its simplicity.\n",

    "\n",
    "> In the univariate linear model, we work with two variables: $y$ is known as the **target** variable, and $x$ is referred to as the **explanatory variable**. Linear regression involves modeling the relationship between these two variables using an **affine function**. Therefore, the formula for the univariate linear model is expressed as:\n",

    ">$$y \\approx \\beta_1 x + \\beta_0 $$\n",

    ">- $y$ represents the variable we aim to predict.\n",
    ">- $x$ stands for the explanatory variable.\n",
    ">- $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_0$ denote the parameters of the affine function. $\\beta_1$ determines the **slope**, while $\\beta_0$ determines the >**y-intercept** (also known as the **bias**).\n",
    ">\n",
    ">**The objective of linear regression is to find the optimal values of $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ for predicting the variable $y$ based on a given value of $x$**."
